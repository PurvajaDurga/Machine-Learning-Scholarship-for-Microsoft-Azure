Topics Covered: Lesson 2.1-2.8
A brief summary of main takeaway from each topic is as follows:
2.1-  Overview of Lesson 2, mentions the topics that are going to be covered in lesson 2
2.2-  Machine learning is a data science technique used to extract patterns from data, allowing computers to identify related data, and
forecast future outcomes, behaviors, and trends. ML is different from traditional programming in a way that in traditional programming we supply the program with input data, 
rules and get the answers as output while in ML we provide input data, answers and get rules in return
2.3-  Machine Learning has vast applications ranging from healthcare, finance, manufacturing, retail to government and education
2.4-  Machine Learning is not a new field, rather it has been there for decades. The recent advances in compute capabilities has allowed wide implementation of this field.
 Deep Learning ⊆ Machine Learning ⊆ Artificial Intelligence
2.5-  Data Science Process typically undergoes following phases:
 Collect Data -> Prepare Data -> Train Model -> Evaluate Model -> Deploy Model
2.6- There can be different types of raw input data in a data science process like Numbers, Text, Images, Videos but every type of data is converted into Numerical
form before being supplied to ML Algorithm
2.7-  Most common type of data we’ll encounter in a data science process is tabular data composed of rows and columns
2.8-  Scaling data means transforming it so that the values fit within some range or scale. Scaling of data is necessary before feeding it to ML algorithm for
efficiency purposes. Standardization and Normalization are the types of Scaling
