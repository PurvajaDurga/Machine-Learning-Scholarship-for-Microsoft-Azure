In this lab, we will be using the Weather Dataset that has weather data for 66 different airports in the USA from April to October 2013. 
We will cluster the dataset into 5 distinct clusters based on key weather metrics, such as visibility, temperature, dew point, wind speed etc.
The goal is to group airports with similar weather conditions.
