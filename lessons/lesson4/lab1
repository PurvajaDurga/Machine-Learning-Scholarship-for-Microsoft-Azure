In this lab, we will be compare the performance of two binary classifiers: 
Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree and Two-Class Logistic Regression for predicting customer churn. 
The goal is to run an expensive marketing campaign for high risk customers; thus,
the precision metric is going to be key in evaluating performance of these two algorithms. 
We will do all of this from the Azure Machine Learning designer without writing a single line of code.
