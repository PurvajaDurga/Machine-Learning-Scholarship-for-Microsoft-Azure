Before training a model, we first need to handle data preparation, so we'll explore this topic first. More specifically, we will go over:

Data importing and transformation
The data management process, including:
The use of datastores and datasets
Versioning
Feature engineering
How to monitor for data drift
Next, we will introduce the basics of model training. We'll cover:

The core model training process
Two of the fundamental machine learning models: Classifier and regressor
The model evaluation process and relevant metrics
And finally, we'll conclude with an introduction to ensemble learning and automated machine learning, two core techniques used to make decisions based on multiple—rather than single—trained models.
