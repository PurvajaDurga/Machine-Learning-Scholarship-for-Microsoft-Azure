Automated machine learning picks an algorithm and hyperparameters for you and generates a model ready for deployment. 
There are several options that you can use to configure automated machine learning experiments.

Configuration options available in automated machine learning:

Select your experiment type: Classification, Regression or Time Series Forecasting
Data source, formats, and fetch data
Choose your compute target
Automated machine learning experiment settings
Run an automated machine learning experiment
Explore model metrics
Register and deploy model
You can create and run automated machine learning experiments in code using the Azure ML Python SDK or if you prefer a no code experience,\
you can also create your automated machine learning experiments in Azure Machine Learning Studio.


In this lab, you learn how to create, run, and explore automated machine learning experiments in the Azure Machine Learning Studio without a single line of code.
As part of this lab, we will be using the Flight Delays data set that is enhanced with the weather data. Based on the enriched dataset,
we will use automated machine learning to find the best performing classification model to predict if a particular flight will be delayed by 15 minutes or more.

Without using pipelines in designer canvas ,we have got the charts
