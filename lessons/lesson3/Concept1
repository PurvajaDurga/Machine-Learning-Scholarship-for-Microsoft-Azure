Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and transforming data to make it more appropriate for data analysis. The process generally follows these main steps:

Explore the raw data and check the general quality of the dataset.
Transform the raw data, by restructuring, normalizing, and cleaning the data. For example, this could involve handling missing values and detecting errors.
Validate and publish the data.
Data wrangling is an iterative process where you do some data transformation then check the results and come back to the process to make improvements.
