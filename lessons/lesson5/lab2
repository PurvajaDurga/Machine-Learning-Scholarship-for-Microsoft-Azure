The main aim of a recommendation system is to recommend one or more items to users of the system. Examples of an item to be recommended, 
might be a movie, restaurant, book, or song. In general, the user is an entity with item preferences such as a person, a group of persons,
or any other type of entity you can imagine.

There are two principal approaches to recommender systems:

The content-based approach, which makes use of features for both users and items. Users can be described by properties such as age or gender. 
Items can be described by properties such as the author or the manufacturer. Typical examples of content-based recommendation systems can be found on social matchmaking sites.
The Collaborative filtering approach, which uses only identifiers of the users and the items. It is based on a matrix of ratings given by the users to the items.
The main source of information about a user is the list the items they’ve rated and the similarity with other users who have rated the same items.
The SVD recommender module in Azure Machine Learning designer is based on the Single Value Decomposition algorithm. It uses identifiers of the users and the items,
and a matrix of ratings given by the users to the items. It’s a typical example of collaborative recommender.
