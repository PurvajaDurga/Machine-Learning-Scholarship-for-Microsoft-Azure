MANAGED SERVICES FOR ML, I've learned to manage to compute resources, model training and evaluation processed, and operational environment. I've also experienced the use of the Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python to program the Azure Machine Learning managed services.
Computing resources
Training compute
Inferencing compute
Notebook environments
Modeling process
Basic modeling
How parts of the modeling process interact when used together
More advanced aspects of the modeling process, like automation via pipelines and end-to-end integrated processes (also known as DevOps for Machine Learning or simply, MLOps)
How to move the results of your modeling work to production environments and make them operational
